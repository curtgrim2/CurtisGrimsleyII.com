<h1> ABOUT ME  </h1>

<div class = "about"> Absorbing the different aspects of college both social and educational. My true goal in <br>
life is to create something that is WORLD CHANGING, an aspiration of mine that dates back to me as a child.<br>
In order to accomplish this goal, I know I'll have to 1. Interact with others within this major<br>
(and maybe even even a little bit outside the major) 2. Use available resources around you and<br>
3. Interact with experienced engineers that will show me the path to reach that goal.
